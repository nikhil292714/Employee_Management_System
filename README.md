# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a web-based application developed using Java Servlets and JDBC. This project is designed to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee data. The system enables seamless interaction with the database, allowing users to add new employees, view employee details, update existing records, and delete employees from the system. All data is directly stored and retrieved from the database using PostgreSQL, ensuring efficient and reliable data management. This project serves as a fundamental example of integrating Java Servlets with JDBC to build dynamic, database-driven web applications.
