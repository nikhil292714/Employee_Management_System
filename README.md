# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a web-based application developed using Java Servlets and JDBC. This project is designed to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing employee information efficiently. The system provides an intuitive interface for administrators to manage employee records, making it simple to add new employees, retrieve detailed information, update existing data, or remove records from the system.

The application uses PostgreSQL as its database management system, ensuring robust, scalable, and secure data storage. By leveraging JDBC, the project establishes a seamless connection between the Java application and the PostgreSQL database, allowing for reliable and dynamic data handling. This project is an excellent demonstration of integrating back-end technologies like Java Servlets and JDBC with a relational database to build real-world web applications. It highlights key concepts such as database connectivity, server-side processing, and efficient data operations, making it a great starting point for those learning web development and database integration with Java.
